The repository collect all my project results of Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree.

## Project 1: Finding Lane Lines on the Road
<img src="https://github.com/RobinCPC/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/765626866c0f3fd38d5a4a17496d153c019eeff2/examples/laneLines_thirdPass.jpg" width="480" alt="Combined Image" />

Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection. For more detail, please click [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobinCPC/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/P1.ipynb)


## Project 2: Traffic Sign Classification
![sample images](https://github.com/RobinCPC/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/examples/ten_sample.png)

Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting. Please click [ipynb](https://github.com/RobinCPC/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) for more detial.


## Project 3: Use Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior
![sample images](https://github.com/RobinCPC/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/examples/center-track.jpg)

Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.


## Project 4: Advanced Lane Finding

Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.


# Project 5: Vehicle Detection and Tracking
![visualized output](https://github.com/RobinCPC/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/output_images/output_boxes.png)

Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from a automotive camera taken during highway driving.
