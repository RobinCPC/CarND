Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection. For more detail, please click [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobinCPC/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/P1.ipynb)

## Project 2: Traffic Sign Classification
![sample images](https://github.com/RobinCPC/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/examples/ten_sample.png)

Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.
